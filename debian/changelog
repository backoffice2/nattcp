nattcp (7.1.5-1ppa1~lucid1) lucid; urgency=low

  * new upstream release

  * optional client/server SSL authentication of the control channel
    SSL handshake is performed on the control channel, remaining exchange
    is not encrypted. Data channels are "secured" against man-in-the-middle attacks
    by checking the peer adress on the connection-accepting side against the
    authenticated control channel peer address.
  * if a server runs in SSL-mode, every client must do so as well
    Client certificates are verified, but their CN is not checked.
    Server certificates are verified and their CN is checked against
    the host given on the command line.
  * xinetd mode will and cannot work in SSL mode
    Data channel addresses cannot be checked against the control channel
    address in xinetd mode since the super-server accepts the connection.
    Also (x)inetd support is probably completely broken currently.
  * PolarSSL v0.10.1 and v0.12.1 are supported as SSL backends

  * UDP "connection" establishment timeout
    In UDP/flip mode the primitive connection establishment mechanism
    is improved by a timeout to prevent hanging server processes.

  * documented github "homepage"
